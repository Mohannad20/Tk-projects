#Tkinter Tic-Tac-Toe Game

###Overview
This [file](https://github.com/Mohannad20/Tk-projects/blob/main/TicTacToe.py) contains a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game or XO or whatever you call it, built using the Tkinter framework. Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a row of their symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). The player who successfully forms a row first wins the game.
